Dice Game
Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The Dice Game is a fun and interactive web application designed to entertain users with a simple yet engaging dice rolling game. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates my proficiency in front-end web development and my ability to create dynamic, user-friendly interfaces.

In the Dice Game, players roll two dice, and the game announces the winner based on the higher roll. The application features smooth animations, responsive design, and real-time updates, providing an enjoyable user experience. This project showcases my skills in JavaScript for handling game logic and DOM manipulation, as well as my attention to detail in creating an intuitive and visually appealing interface.
